# Project Notes & Architecture

## 1. Why SQLite?

- Lightweight & file-based â€” perfect for assignment environment
- Zero setup, fast queries
- Fits the "24-hour build simple DB" requirement

---

## 2. Backend Design

- **Express** chosen for simplicity and clarity
- Routes separated into `tasks.routes.js`
- Database init in `database.js`
- Uses parameterized SQL queries for security & reliability

## 3. Task Schema

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|
| id | INTEGER PK | Unique task ID |
| title | TEXT | Task title |
| description | TEXT | Details |
| priority | Low/Medium/High | Task importance |
| due_date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD format |
| status | Open/In Progress/Done | Task lifecycle |
| created_at | timestamp | Auto-record created time |

- Clear UI for evaluator

---

## 5. Learning Outcomes
